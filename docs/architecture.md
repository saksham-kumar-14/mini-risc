# MiniRISC: ISA Specification and Design Report

Architecture and instruction-set submission · 4 October 2026

## 1. Architecture overview

MiniRISC is a 32-bit, load/store, three-operand RISC processor. It has separate instruction and data memories (Harvard), a word-addressed program counter, a non-pipelined datapath, and a small 4-state control FSM. Almost every instruction completes in one clock; `LD` takes two.

**Programmer-visible state**

- **R0–R15**: 32-bit general registers. R0 must read as zero: `LI`, `MOVE`, `BZ`, `MFHI` and `MFLO` all depend on it. R15 is the link register, written implicitly by `JAL`.
- **HI, LO**: hold the 64-bit result of `MULU`. Inside the register file they sit at addresses 16 and 17, outside the R0–R15 range the assembler should expose. They are read only through `MFHI` / `MFLO`.
- **PC**: counts words, not bytes. Sequential flow is PC + 1.

### 1.1 Datapath walk-through (Fig. 1)

1. **Fetch.** The instruction ROM is addressed with `next_pc` (not `pc_out`), so the PC register and the ROM output both update on the same clock edge. `ic_enable` freezes the ROM output, which is how the current instruction is held during multi-cycle ops and `HALT`.
2. **Decode.** Fields are wired straight out of the instruction word (no decoder): `opcode` \[31:26\], `rd` \[25:21\], `rs` \[20:16\], `rt` \[15:11\], `shamt` \[10:6\], `fn` \[5:0\], `imm` \[15:0\], `jta` \[25:0\]. Only `opcode` and `fn` go to the control path.
3. **Register read.** Two read ports. The `rs` address passes through a 2:1 mux (`force_rs_zero`); the `rt` address passes through an 8:1 mux (`rt_sel`). Section 8.1 explains why.
4. **Immediate.** A 16→32 sign extender feeds a 2:1 mux that picks zero extension for logic immediates (`alu_src` and `alu_func[5:3] == 011`). A second mux (`alu_src`) chooses `rt_out` or the extended immediate as the ALU's **y** operand.
5. **ALU.** x = `rs_out` (no mux), y = `rt_out` or immediate. See 1.2.
6. **Data memory.** Address = `alu_out_lo`, store data = `rt_out`, controlled by `mem_read` / `mem_write`.
7. **Write-back.** `reg_in_src` chooses what is written: memory data, ALU result, PC + 1, or 0. `reg_dst` chooses the destination address. A second write port takes the ALU's high result for HI.
8. **Next PC.** The next-address decoder (1.3).

### 1.2 ALU (Fig. 2)

The ALU contains five units in parallel, and `alu_func[5:3]` selects which result leaves. `alu_func[2:0]` selects the operation inside the unit. Because the R-type `fn` field uses exactly this encoding, **fn is the ALU control word** and no ALU decoder is needed.

| alu\_func\[5:3\] | Unit | alu\_func\[2:0\] operations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 000 | Load-upper | LUI (000) |
| 001 | Compare / set | SLT 000, SGT 001, SLE 010, SGE 011, SEQ 100, SNE 101 |
| 010 | Arithmetic | ADD 000, SUB 001, MUL 010, MULU 011 |
| 011 | Logic | AND 000, OR 001, NOT 010, NOR 011, XOR 100 |
| 100 | Shift | SLL 000, SRL 001, SRA 010 |

The arithmetic unit also produces `high` (upper 32 bits of a product) and the overflow flag `ovfl`. The compare unit produces the flags `lt gt le ge eq ne`, which go to the next-address decoder. The `high` output passes through a 2:1 mux (select = `hi_lo_enable`, other input = 0), so HI is written only by `MULU`.

### 1.3 Next-address decoder (Fig. 3)

A branch-condition checker combines the compare flags, `ovfl`, `br_type` and `is_branch` into `br_true`. `br_true` AND-gates the sign-extended offset, and one adder computes `PC + (br_true ? offset : 0) + 1` with carry-in = 1. So the same adder produces both the sequential PC + 1 and the branch target, and its output is also `inc_pc`, the return address stored by `JAL`. The final mux is controlled by `pc_src`:

| pc\_src | next\_pc |
| --- | --- |
| 00 | adder output: PC + 1 (+ offset if branch taken) |
| 01 | `jta` (J, JAL) |
| 10 | `rs` register value (JR) |
| 11 | 0 (start-up / system vector) |

### 1.4 Control path FSM (Fig. 4)

| State | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| IDLE | `pc_enable = ic_enable = 1`, `pc_src = 11`: PC is forced to 0 and instruction 0 is pre-fetched. Moves to RUN when `start` is asserted. |
| RUN | Decodes `opcode` and drives all control signals. Single-cycle instructions stay in RUN. Multi-cycle instructions go to WAIT. `HALT` or an illegal opcode goes to DONE. |
| WAIT | Holds the PC and ROM output for a multi-cycle instruction (`halt_period` counts down), then commits and returns to RUN. |
| DONE | Processor stopped. |

`reset` is asynchronous and returns to IDLE from any state. The sketch in Fig. 4 shows WAIT → DONE; the code actually goes WAIT → RUN, and DONE is entered from RUN on `HALT` / illegal opcode (see section 10).

## 2. Instruction formats

All instructions are 32 bits. Fields are at fixed positions in every format, and **the destination register is always in bits 25:21**.

| Format | 31:26 | 25:21 | 20:16 | 15:11 | 10:6 | 5:0 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| R | op | rd | rs | rt | shamt | fn |
| I (ALU, LI, LUI, LD, ST) | op | rd | rs | imm\[15:0\] (overlaps rt / shamt / fn) |  |  |
| Branch | op | rs2 (rd field) | rs | offset\[15:0\] |  |  |
| J | op | jta\[25:0\] |  |  |  |  |

- Only R-type (`op = 100000`) takes the ALU function from instruction bits 5:0. For every other format those bits belong to the immediate, so **each I-type instruction has its own opcode** and the control path generates `alu_func`.
- In the branch format the first register field is the second comparison register; it is not written.
- `shamt` exists in the R format but the datapath does not use it. Shift amounts come through the ALU's y operand (register or immediate).

## 3. Opcode allocation

6-bit opcode. The top two bits give the class, the rest identify the instruction.

| op range | Class | Opcodes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 000000 | No-op | NOP |
| 010000–010111 | Conditional branches | BEQ 010000, BZ 010001, BNE 010010, BLT 010011, BLE 010100, BGT 010101, BGE 010110, BV 010111 |
| 100000–100111 | R-type, constants, moves, memory | R-type 100000, MFHI 100001, LI 100010, LUI 100011, MOVE 100100, LD 100101, ST 100110, MFLO 100111 |
| 101000–101011 | Jumps | J 101000, JAL 101001, JR 101011 (101010 reserved) |
| 110000–111110 | I-type ALU | ADDI 110000, SUBI 110001, ANDI 110010, ORI 110011, NORI 110100, XORI 110101, SLLI 110110, SRLI 110111, SRAI 111000, SLTI 111001, SGTI 111010, SLEI 111011, SGEI 111100, SEQI 111101, SNEI 111110 |
| 111111 | Stop | HALT |

Unassigned opcodes are treated as illegal and send the FSM to DONE. Rationale:

- **NOP = all zeros**: zero-filled (unprogrammed) memory executes harmlessly. **HALT = all ones**: a fetch from an erased or floating-high bus stops the machine instead of running garbage.
- Prefix `11` always means "ALU with immediate", `01` always means "conditional branch", so the class is visible from two bits.
- The I-type opcodes follow the same order as the R-type functions (ADD, SUB, AND, OR, NOR, XOR, shifts, compares). `MUL`, `MULU` and `NOT` have no immediate form because they are not useful with a constant.

## 5. Immediate, branch, jump and memory conventions

**Immediates.** 16 bits. Sign extended for all instructions except the logic immediates (`ANDI ORI NORI XORI`), which are zero extended. Reason: `LUI rd, hi16` followed by `ORI rd, rd, lo16` builds any 32-bit constant, and this only works if `ORI` does not smear a sign bit over the upper half. `LUI` ignores the extension because it uses only imm\[15:0\]. Selection is done by `alu_src & (alu_func[5:3] == 011)`.

**Branches.** Compare-and-branch in one instruction, with no condition-code register. The two registers are `rs` and the `rd` field. The target is **PC-relative in words: PC + 1 + sext(offset16)**, a reach of about ±32K instructions. `BZ` compares `rs` with R0. `BV` tests overflow of rs − rd (it performs its own subtraction, it does not look at an earlier instruction). Not-taken branches fall through to PC + 1.

**Jumps.** `J` / `JAL` use a 26-bit absolute word address (`jta`). `JAL` saves PC + 1 in R15. `JR rs` jumps to a register, which is how a function returns (`JR R15`).

**Memory.** Base + displacement only: address = `rs + sext(imm)`, computed by the ALU's ADD. Loads and stores are word (32-bit) accesses; there are no byte or halfword instructions. For `ST`, the register named in the `rd` field is the value stored. `LD` takes two cycles (sections 1.4 and 8.4).

**No exceptions.** Arithmetic overflow does not trap; it is observable only through `BV`.

## 6. MUL and MULU semantics

The ISA provides MUL and MULU; there is no MAC instruction.

|  | MUL | MULU |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Encoding | R-type, fn = 010010 | R-type, fn = 010011 |
| Result | rd ← (rs × rt)\[31:0\] | {HI, LO} ← rs × rt, 64 bits, unsigned |
| Destination | `reg_dst = 01` (rd) | `reg_dst = 10` (address 17 = LO) |
| `hi_lo_enable` | 0 | 1 |
| Reading the result | directly in rd | `MFHI rd`, `MFLO rd` |

The low 32 bits of a product are the same for signed and unsigned operands, so `MUL` needs no signed/unsigned variant. `MULU` writes LO through the normal write port (the `reg_dst` mux supplies address 17) and HI through the dedicated second write port (`reg_in_hi`, enabled by `hi_lo_enable`), both in the same commit cycle. Because the 64-bit product is kept in HI:LO, a MAC (HI:LO += rs × rt) could be added later with only a new `fn` code and an adder on the accumulate path.

**Timing.** In the current `control_path.v` the multi-cycle hook for MUL/MULU is commented out, so they commit in one cycle. The planned iterative multiplier uses the same WAIT mechanism as `LD` with `multi_cycles = 32`, giving 33 WAIT cycles.

## 7. Justification of the ISA organisation

- **Load/store, 3-operand, fixed 32-bit format.** Simple decode, and each field is wired directly with no instruction-length logic.
- **Destination always at 25:21.** One write-address source for almost every instruction. This is why the I-type destination is `rd` and why `reg_dst = 00` (rt) is never needed.
- **16-bit immediate over rt/shamt/fn.** Gives practical constants and offsets. The cost is that I-type has no `fn`, so each I-type has its own opcode and the control path emits `alu_func`.
- **`fn` equals the ALU control code.** R-type needs no ALU decoder, and I-type reuses the same codes.
- **Compare-and-branch, set-on-compare.** No flags register, so no hidden state between instructions. Both forms are provided so compilers can choose.
- **Pseudo-instructions enforced in hardware.** `LI`, `MOVE`, `MFHI`, `MFLO`, `BZ` reuse ADD/SUB with an operand forced to R0, so correctness does not depend on the assembler filling unused fields with zero.
- **HI/LO for wide multiply.** Keeps the register file at two read ports and one main write port, and gives a path to MAC.
- **Word-addressed PC with PC + 1.** Removes the 2-bit alignment handling; one adder serves PC + 1, branch target and the `JAL` link.
- **Non-pipelined with a tiny FSM.** No hazards, forwarding or delay slots; the cost is lower throughput, acceptable for the course.

## Appendix A. Control words

Select encodings. **reg\_dst**: 00 rt (unused), 01 rd, 10 LO, 11 R15. **reg\_in**: 00 memory, 01 ALU, 10 PC + 1, 11 zero. **pc\_src**: 00 PC + 1 (+ offset), 01 jta, 10 rs, 11 zero. **br\_t**: 001 EQ, 010 NE, 011 LT, 100 LE, 101 GT, 110 GE, 111 overflow. **rt\_sel**: 000 rt, 001 rd, 010 R0, 011 HI, 100 LO.

`pc_en` and `ic_en` are 1 for every instruction except `HALT` (0). For `LD` they are 0 in its first cycle and 1 in the commit cycle; the table shows the commit cycle, except `ld` (mem\_read), which is 1 only in the first cycle. X = don't care. `frz` = `force_rs_zero`.
